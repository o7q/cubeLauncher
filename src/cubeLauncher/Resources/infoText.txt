cubeLauncher by o7q
A simple, lightweight installation manager for Minecraft.

This tool works like CurseForge except it is inside of a single executable file without the need of an installer.
It creates its own launcher profile within the Minecraft launcher preventing it from interfering with any previous installations.

* Farther documentation can be found on the cubeLauncher GitHub page which can be accessed by double-clicking on the "cubeLauncher banner" again
